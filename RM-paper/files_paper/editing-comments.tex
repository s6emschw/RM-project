\begin{itemize}
    \item Should we use equations 1 and 2 or is it better if we just introduce the notation for the minimization problems? I included the SRR plus the shrinkage penalty term to show where the $\lambda$ tuning parameter comes from, since it's frequently mentioned in the literature we are using. However, it may become tedious to always describe the equivalence between $\lambda$ and $t$. 
    \item Should we stick with the matrix notation in the minimization problems or switch to the summation notation? 
    \item I would remove the lagrangian formulation, I don't think it's necessary. 
    \item To save space, I put the constraints of the minimization problems on the same line as the corresponding objection function. Hope that's okay.
