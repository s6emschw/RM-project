\section{Statistical properties of regularization methods}
\label{section:theory}

\noindent In the following section, we begin with a brief discussion of the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model and its potential drawbacks in the presence of high dimensionality and/or multicollinearity among regressors. We then introduce three commonly used regularized regression techniques - ridge, lasso, and elastic net - that help mitigate these potential disadvantages of OLS.
